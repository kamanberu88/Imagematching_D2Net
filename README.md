# Imagematching_D2Net

## Overview

To address the problem that matching low-resolution images is affected by noise, which makes location estimation difficult,
a method using deep learning feature matching is proposed.

The main idea and code of feature extracting in this repository are based on [D2-Net](https://dusmanu.com/publications/d2-net.html).

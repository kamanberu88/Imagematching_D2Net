# Imagematching_D2Net

## Overview

To address the problem that matching low-resolution images is affected by noise, which makes location estimation difficult,a method using deep learning feature matching is proposed.

The main idea and code of feature extracting in this repository are based on [D2-Net](https://dusmanu.com/publications/d2-net.html).



## Getting start:
Python 3.9+ is recommended for running our code. [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) can be used to install the required packages:
### Dependencies

- PyTorch 
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- skimage
